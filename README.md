**DOCX to PDF Converter Web Application**
This is a Node.js-based web application that allows users to upload DOCX files and convert them to password-protected PDF files. The conversion is handled using LibreOffice for DOCX to PDF transformation, while qPDF is used to apply password protection on the resulting PDF. The application is containerized using Docker to simplify deployment and portability.
